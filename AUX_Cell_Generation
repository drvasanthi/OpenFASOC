# ALIGN: Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists

The goal of ALIGN (Analog Layout, Intelligently Generated from Netlists) is to automatically translate an unannotated (or partially annotated) SPICE netlist of an analog circuit to a GDSII layout.

** The Auxilary cell of any design is generate through the ALIGN tool

## Inputs

* SPICE netlist  
* SKY130 PDK

## Outputs

* Design JSON: Final layout in JSON form which can be viewed using the ALIGN Viewer.
* Layout GDS: Final layout of the design. The output GDS can be imported into any GDSII viewer.
